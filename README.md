# Forgive Yourself

The purpose of this application is to help track your mistakes during the year.
At least once a year you should forgive yourself and wipe the slate clean.
You cannot edit or remove individual items, only forgive yourself by wiping the slate.
You can optionally set a notification reminder. Maybe New Year, your birthday, Chinese New Year, Ramadan, or Yom Kippur.
